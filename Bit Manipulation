AND
0 & 0 = 0
1 & 0 = 0
1 & 1 = 1

OR
0 | 0 = 0
1 | 0 = 1
1 | 1 = 1

XOR
0 ^ 0 = 0
1 ^ 0 = 1
1 ^ 1 = 0

//x is the number that we used here
Get ith of bit
x & (1 << i) != 1

Set ith of bit
x | (1 << i)

Clear ith of bit
x & (~(1 << i))

Flip the ith bit
x ^ (1 << i)

Check is ith bit set
if(1 & (x >> i)) 1 is true 0 is false

Check if x is even
(1 & x) == 0

Check if x is power of 2
(x & x - 1) == 0
